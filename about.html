        <h2>About me</h2>
        <article>
        <p>
        <strong>Hey there</strong>, <br>
        My name is Pierre Collier. What you are viewing on your screen right now is my first step. The first step to becoming a fully-fledged front-end developer, that is. </p>
        <p>So, why Pierrot Kwame? <br>
        Pierrot is a reference to the nickname my mother would sometimes use for me when I was a child. Simply put it is the French diminutive form of my first given name. It is also the name of a sad clown, the victim of unrequited love, a common pantomime character in commedia dell'arte. Hopefully, this was nothing my mother had in mind. <br>
        Kwame is my second given name, a reference to Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah. Nkrumah was the first elected president in a newly independent nation after colonialism. A person held in high regard by my parents due to his socialist ideology and prominent ideas of an united Africa. I can appreciate the symbolism in giving me the name, but I am also aware of Nkrumah being anything but a perfect leader. As politicians seldom are.</p>
        <p>The blog posts here are of course not written by me. They are rather an attempt to present me and my interests through excerpts from Wikipedia.</p>
        <p>If you would like to know more of me in a professional capacity, on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-collier-0b9577196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> is where you can find what I did before my intention to change careers. 
        You can find me and any repos of mine on <a href="https://github.com/pierrotkwame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. Also where this site is hosted.
